      <description>In Continuous reteaming: planning day workshop - Achievements and target outcomes, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen how to start building alignment by sharing both the achievements and the target outcomes for the next quarter. It is a worthy exercise in itself, which should improve collaboration and reduce waste. However, we are a long way from having a new team structure for the next quarter. So how do you ensure that people self-select into teams that are not entirely crazy?</description>

      <description>In Continuous Reteaming and Self-Selection, I gave a general overview of the system of work I experimented with for 18 months. I will now detail various parts, starting with the planning day.
Planning day format Our planning day is essential to achieve our goals: self-selection and self-organisation. It follows the following structure:
 Agenda &amp;amp; intro to the day Last quarter achievements Target outcomes Presentation of the enabling constraints Iterations to form the teams Broadcast of the plan  Agenda &amp;amp; intro This workshop is going to be new for at least some of your colleagues.</description>

      <description>In the book Drive, Dan Pink proposes that the 3 sources of intrinsic motivation are autonomy, mastery and purpose. In my experience, our system of work is rarely aligned with that. More often than not:
 You are assigned to a project by your manager, You follow a prescribed methodology like Scrum or Kanban (or have none at all and no forum to reflect), You have a long list of requirements that sound quite disconnected from any tangible business impact (possibly written by a PO/PM, sometimes they may even let you talk to the customer ;-)).</description>
