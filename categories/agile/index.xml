      <description>In the book Drive, Dan Pink proposes that the 3 sources of intrinsic motivation are autonomy, mastery and purpose. In my experience, our system of work is rarely aligned with that. More often than not:
 You are assigned to a project by your manager, You follow a prescribed methodology like Scrum or Kanban (or have none at all and no forum to reflect), You have a long list of requirements that sound quite disconnected from any tangible business impact (possibly written by a PO/PM, sometimes they may even let you talk to the customer ;-)).</description>
